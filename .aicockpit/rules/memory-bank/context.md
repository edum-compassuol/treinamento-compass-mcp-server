# Current Context - 4Devs MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

- **Phase**: Architecture and planning completed
- **Status**: Ready for implementation - comprehensive documentation and architecture completed
- **Priority**: Technology stack selection and MCP server implementation

## Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Completed with all core files (product.md, architecture.md, tech.md, context.md)
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Added comprehensive OpenAPI specification (4Devs_OpenAPI.yaml)
- **MCP Inspector Integration**: Added official MCP Inspector testing documentation and workflows
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Enhanced product vision to emphasize AI Code Assistant integration gap
- **Brazilian UF Resource**: Documented complete Brazilian Federal Units resource architecture
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Enhanced all memory bank files with detailed technical specifications
- **Testing Guide Addition**: Created comprehensive testing-guide.md with npm and Docker testing procedures
- **Project Prompts**: Added prompts.md file with complete MCP server creation, enhancement, and deployment workflows

## Current State

- **Implementation**: Ready to begin - no source code files exist yet
- **Documentation**: Complete with OpenAPI specification, API documentation, and comprehensive architecture
- **Architecture**: Fully documented with MCP protocol compliance, OpenAPI integration, and testing strategies
- **Technology Stack**: Decision pending (TypeScript vs Python) - both paths fully documented
- **Testing Strategy**: Complete with MCP Inspector integration and individual tool testing requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Technology Stack Decision**: Choose between TypeScript/Node.js or Python implementation
2. **Project Bootstrapping**: Use MCP development protocol (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server` or `pip install mcp`)
3. **Core Implementation**: Implement 6 MCP tools based on OpenAPI specifications
4. **Brazilian UF Resource**: Implement static resource with all 27 Federal Units
5. **MCP Inspector Testing**: Test each tool individually using official MCP Inspector
6. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive README.md with usage examples and API integration

## Key Decisions Pending

- **Technology Choice**: TypeScript (web/JS integration) vs Python (data science/ML workflows)
- **OpenAPI Type Generation**: Use openapi-typescript (TS) or pydantic models (Python)
- **Error Handling Implementation**: Implement OpenAPI-compliant error responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Determine if needed based on 4Devs API behavior during testing

## Important Technical Details

- **Single Endpoint**: `/ferramentas_online.php` with `acao` parameter for tool selection
- **Request Format**: POST with `multipart/form-data` encoding (not JSON)
- **Response Types**: Mixed JSON (person data), HTML (city lists), and plain text (documents)
- **Geographic Workflow**: Two-step process (UF selection → city loading → data generation)
- **Batch Limits**: 1-30 records per request for person generator
- **UF Validation**: All 27 Brazilian Federal Units supported with OpenAPI enum validation
- **MCP Protocol**: Full compliance with logging patterns, testing requirements, and resource definitions

## Project Files Status

- **README.md**: Minimal (needs comprehensive documentation)
- **4Devs_OpenAPI.yaml**: Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **prompts.md**: Complete workflow documentation for MCP server creation, enhancement, and deployment
- **Memory Bank**: Complete with all core files and comprehensive testing guide
  - **testing-guide.md**: Comprehensive testing procedures for npm and Docker deployments
  - **All core files**: product.md, architecture.md, tech.md, context.md, brief.md, api_documentation.md
- **Source Code**: Not implemented yet
- **Tests**: Not implemented yet
- **Configuration**: Not implemented yet

## Ready for Implementation

The project now has complete architecture documentation, OpenAPI specifications, MCP Inspector testing strategies, Brazilian UF resource definitions, and comprehensive testing procedures. All technical decisions are documented, including detailed workflows for creation, enhancement, deployment, and testing. The implementation can proceed following the MCP development protocol with full testing coverage for both npm and Docker deployment methods.

## Additional Resources Available

- **Complete Workflow Documentation**: prompts.md provides step-by-step instructions for MCP server creation, enhancement, and deployment
- **Testing Procedures**: testing-guide.md offers comprehensive testing roadmap for both npm package and Docker image validation
- **Deployment Guidelines**: Includes GitHub Actions workflows, package.json configuration, and .npmrc setup
- **Docker Integration**: Complete Dockerfile example and container testing procedures
