# Current Context - 4Devs MCP Server

## Current Work Focus

- **Phase**: Initial project setup and planning
- **Status**: Pre-implementation - comprehensive API documentation completed
- **Priority**: Memory bank initialization and project architecture planning

## Recent Changes

- Memory bank initialization in progress
- Comprehensive API documentation analysis completed (brief.md)
- Product vision and user experience goals defined
- Project structure analysis: minimal setup with only README.md and .gitignore

## Current State

- **Implementation**: Not started - no source code files exist yet
- **Documentation**: Complete API specification available for 6 endpoints
- **Architecture**: Needs to be designed and documented
- **Technology Stack**: Not selected yet (TypeScript vs Python decision pending)

## Next Steps

1. Complete memory bank initialization (architecture.md, tech.md)
2. Technology stack selection (TypeScript/Node.js vs Python)
3. Project bootstrapping using MCP SDK
4. Core server implementation with 6 API tools
5. Testing and validation of each tool
6. Documentation and deployment setup

## Key Decisions Pending

- **Technology Choice**: TypeScript (web/JS integration) vs Python (data science/ML)
- **Authentication**: 4Devs API appears to be public (no auth requirements identified)
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Need to define approach for API failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Determine if needed for 4Devs API

## Important Notes

- 4Devs API uses single endpoint with `acao` parameter for different functions
- All requests use POST with form-data format
- Geographic data (cities) requires two-step process: get cities by state first
- Batch generation limited to 1-30 records per request
